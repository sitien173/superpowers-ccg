# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

## Overview

Help turn ideas into fully formed designs and specs through natural collaborative dialogue.

Start by understanding the current project context, then ask questions one at a time to refine the idea. Once you understand what you're building, present the design in small sections (200-300 words), checking after each section whether it looks right so far.

## Protocol Threshold (Required)

Follow the [CP Protocol Threshold] injected by hooks.

IMPORTANT: "standalone" means the CP block must be its own block at the top of the reply.
It does NOT mean you should stop after the CP block. Continue in the same reply.

- Before the first Task call: output a standalone [CP1 Assessment] block at the top of the reply; then continue with your actual content (and tool calls if needed) in the same reply.
- Before providing a final design conclusion or requesting review: output a standalone [CP3 Assessment] block at the top of the reply; then continue with the conclusion/next actions in the same reply.

If unmet -> immediately perform the CP assessment, then continue the flow right away; do not stop or interrupt.

## The Process

**Understanding the idea:**

- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)
- Ask questions one at a time to refine the idea
- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too
- Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions
- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria

**Model tip for exploration:** When dispatching subagents to explore the codebase, use `model: haiku` for fast, cost-effective searches. Haiku excels at file pattern matching and quick lookups.

Hard reminder: before your first Task tool call, you must output a standalone `[CP1 Assessment]` block (fixed format with fields).

**► Checkpoint 1 (Task Analysis):** After understanding the idea, apply checkpoint logic from `coordinating-multi-model-work/checkpoints.md`:

- Collect: task description, files involved, tech stack
- Check critical task conditions → Match: invoke directly
- Evaluate general task signals → Positive: invoke
- Neither: Claude handles independently

**Exploring approaches:**

- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning
- Lead with your recommended option and explain why

**► Checkpoint 2 (Mid-Review):** When multiple approaches have significant trade-offs, apply checkpoint logic from `coordinating-multi-model-work/checkpoints.md`:

- Multiple implementation approaches to choose from → invoke cross-validation
- Potential performance/security issues discovered → invoke domain expert

**Presenting the design:**

- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the design
- Hard reminder: before giving a final design conclusion or claiming the design is finalized, you must output a standalone `[CP3 Assessment]` block (fixed format with fields).
- Break it into sections of 200-300 words
- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far
- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing
- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense

## After the Design

**Documentation (must not be skipped):**

Once the user confirms the design looks right, do ALL of the following:

1. Ensure the output directory exists (create `docs/plans/` if missing)
2. Write the final design content to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`
3. Then tell the user the file path you wrote

Only commit if the user explicitly asks you to commit.

**Implementation (if continuing):**

- Ask: "Ready to set up for implementation?"
- Use superpowers:using-git-worktrees to create isolated workspace
- Use superpowers:writing-plans to create detailed implementation plan

## Key Principles

- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions
- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer than open-ended when possible
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features from all designs
- **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling
- **Incremental validation** - Present design in sections, validate each
- **Be flexible** - Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense

## Multi-Model Design Validation

**Related skill:** superpowers:coordinating-multi-model-work

At checkpoints, when invoking external models:

1. **Apply semantic routing** using `coordinating-multi-model-work/routing-decision.md`
2. **Notify user**: "I will use [model] to evaluate this design"
3. **Call MCP tool** with English prompts (see `coordinating-multi-model-work/INTEGRATION.md` for templates). Use Codex MCP (`mcp__codex__codex`) for backend, Gemini MCP (`mcp__gemini__gemini`) for frontend, and call both in parallel for CROSS_VALIDATION.
4. **Integrate results** into design recommendation

**Full checkpoint logic:** See `coordinating-multi-model-work/checkpoints.md`

**Fallback (Fail-Closed):** If Codex MCP / Gemini MCP is unavailable or times out when Routing != CLAUDE, STOP and follow `coordinating-multi-model-work/GATE.md` (do not proceed with a final design recommendation).
