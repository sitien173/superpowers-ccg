# Routing Decision Framework

## Overview

This framework guides Claude in making semantic routing decisions for multi-model task distribution. Instead of relying on hardcoded scoring algorithms, Claude analyzes task characteristics using reasoning to determine the optimal execution model.

**Purpose**: Enable intelligent, context-aware routing decisions that adapt to task nuances rather than rigid rule-based scoring.

## When to Use

Invoke this framework when a skill needs to call external models (Codex/Gemini) via codeagent-wrapper. Before making the call, analyze the task using the dimensions below.

**Trigger Points**:
- Before executing any implementation task
- During debugging and root cause analysis
- When generating tests or verification plans
- Before code review or design validation
- During plan execution with multi-step tasks

## Standard Information Set

Collect these inputs for decision-making:

1. **Task Description** - User's request in natural language
   - What is the user asking for?
   - What problem needs to be solved?
   - What is the expected outcome?

2. **File Information** - File paths and extensions involved in the task
   - Which files will be created or modified?
   - What are the file extensions?
   - What directories are they in?

3. **Tech Stack** - Inferred from project files
   - Check `package.json`, `go.mod`, `requirements.txt`, etc.
   - Identify frameworks (React, Vue, Django, Express, etc.)
   - Determine frontend vs backend technologies

## Analysis Dimensions

### 1. Task Essence

**Question:** What problem is this task primarily solving?

**Consider:**
- **Core objective**: Fix bug, add feature, optimize performance, refactor code, design architecture
- **Domain focus**: Data processing, user interface, business logic, infrastructure, integration
- **Primary skill required**: Design thinking, algorithmic problem-solving, UI/UX implementation, system integration

**Examples:**
- "Add dark mode toggle" → UI feature implementation
- "Optimize database queries" → Performance optimization
- "Implement authentication" → Security and business logic
- "Fix rendering bug" → UI debugging

### 2. Technical Domain

**Question:** Does this task lean toward frontend (UI/interaction) or backend (logic/data)?

**Frontend Indicators:**
- UI components, layouts, visual design
- User interactions, event handling
- Styling, animations, responsive design
- Client-side state management (Redux, Zustand, Pinia)
- Browser APIs, DOM manipulation
- Accessibility (a11y) concerns
- Frontend routing and navigation
- Component composition and props

**Backend Indicators:**
- API endpoints, server logic
- Database operations, data models, ORM
- Algorithms, performance optimization
- Authentication, authorization, security
- Background jobs, message queues
- Server-side infrastructure
- Caching strategies
- Data validation and business rules

**Ambiguous Cases (Require Deeper Analysis):**
- Full-stack integration (API + component)
- Configuration files (depends on context)
- Testing (depends on what's being tested)
- Utilities (depends on usage context)
- TypeScript/JavaScript files (check directory and imports)

### 3. Complexity & Uncertainty

**Question:** Does this task involve multiple domains or uncertain factors?

**High Complexity Indicators:**
- Spans frontend and backend simultaneously
- Multiple possible root causes (debugging scenarios)
- Architectural design decisions affecting both layers
- Critical changes affecting core functionality
- Insufficient information to determine domain
- Integration between multiple systems
- Data flow across layers (client → server → database)

**Low Complexity Indicators:**
- Single file change in a clear domain
- Well-defined scope (e.g., "fix typo", "update color")
- Isolated component or function
- Documentation or simple configuration updates

## Decision Output

Based on the analysis, output:

```
**Routing Decision:** [GEMINI | CODEX | CROSS_VALIDATION | CLAUDE]
**Rationale:** [One sentence explaining the decision based on analysis]
```

### Routing Targets

- **GEMINI** - Frontend expert for UI, components, styles, interactions, client-side logic
- **CODEX** - Backend expert for APIs, databases, algorithms, performance, server-side logic
- **CROSS_VALIDATION** - Both models for full-stack tasks, architectural decisions, or high uncertainty
- **CLAUDE** - Simple tasks that don't require specialized external models (docs, configs, simple edits)

## Decision Logic

Apply this reasoning framework:

```
1. Analyze Task Essence:
   - What is the core problem?
   - What domain does it primarily affect?

2. Evaluate Technical Domain:
   - Count frontend indicators vs backend indicators
   - Check file paths and extensions
   - Review task keywords and description

3. Assess Complexity:
   - Does it span multiple domains?
   - Is the root cause uncertain?
   - Are there multiple perspectives needed?

4. Make Decision:
   IF (strong frontend signals AND weak/no backend signals):
       → GEMINI

   ELSE IF (strong backend signals AND weak/no frontend signals):
       → CODEX

   ELSE IF (strong signals in both domains OR high uncertainty OR architectural):
       → CROSS_VALIDATION

   ELSE IF (simple task OR documentation OR trivial config):
       → CLAUDE

   ELSE (ambiguous case):
       → CROSS_VALIDATION (err on the side of getting multiple perspectives)
```

**Key Principle**: When in doubt, prefer CROSS_VALIDATION over guessing. Multiple perspectives are better than potentially wrong routing.

## User Notification

After making the decision, notify the user with this format:

```
我将使用 [模型名] 来 [处理任务类型]
```

**Examples:**
- "我将使用 Codex 来分析这个 API 性能问题"
- "我将使用 Gemini 来优化这个组件的样式"
- "我将使用交叉验证来评估这个全栈架构设计"
- "我将使用 Codex 来实现数据库查询优化"
- "我将使用 Gemini 来创建响应式布局"

**Principles:**
- Keep it brief and informative (one sentence)
- Don't show detailed reasoning process to user
- Don't interrupt the workflow with excessive explanation
- Use Chinese for user-facing notifications
- Clearly state which model and what task type

## Reference Knowledge

While making decisions, you can reference `routing-rules.md` for:
- File extension categorization
- Directory structure patterns
- Keyword associations
- Scoring heuristics (as reference, not strict rules)

However, these are **reference knowledge** only, not strict rules. Your semantic understanding and reasoning should guide the final decision. The old scoring algorithm is provided for context, but you should use judgment rather than calculating scores.

## Integration with Skills

Skills that reference this framework:

- `debugging-systematically` - Root cause analysis and multi-perspective debugging
- `brainstorming` - Design evaluation and solution exploration
- `writing-plans` - Technical proposal design and task planning
- `executing-plans` - Implementation routing for plan tasks
- `developing-with-subagents` - Subtask distribution to specialized agents
- `requesting-code-review` - Cross-review and validation strategy
- `test-driven-development` - Test generation routing
- `verifying-before-completion` - Verification strategy routing

Each skill should:
1. Collect the standard information set
2. Apply the analysis dimensions
3. Make a routing decision with rationale
4. Notify the user
5. Execute the task using the chosen model(s)

## Fallback Handling (Fail-Closed)

If codeagent-wrapper is not available or invocation fails (timeout, tool unavailable, permission blocked):

Follow `coordinating-multi-model-work/GATE.md`.

- **STOP** in a BLOCKED state.
- Do **not** proceed with a final answer or “best effort” solution without external output.
- Provide the rerun command and the unblock steps.

## Best Practices

1. **Always collect complete information** before making a decision
2. **Prefer CROSS_VALIDATION** when uncertain - multiple perspectives reduce risk
3. **Keep user notifications brief** - don't overwhelm with technical details
4. **Use routing-rules.md as reference** but don't blindly follow scoring
5. **Consider the task holistically** - file extensions alone are not enough
6. **Think about the actual work** - what expertise is truly needed?
7. **When debugging**, prefer CROSS_VALIDATION unless root cause is clearly isolated
8. **For architecture**, almost always use CROSS_VALIDATION
9. **For simple tasks**, don't over-engineer - Claude is often sufficient

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Don't**: Route based solely on file extension
✅ **Do**: Analyze the actual task and required expertise

❌ **Don't**: Use hardcoded scoring algorithms mechanically
✅ **Do**: Apply semantic reasoning to understand task needs

❌ **Don't**: Route everything to CROSS_VALIDATION "to be safe"
✅ **Do**: Use CROSS_VALIDATION when genuinely beneficial (multi-domain, uncertain, critical)

❌ **Don't**: Skip user notification
✅ **Do**: Always inform user of routing decision (except for CLAUDE fallback)

❌ **Don't**: Ignore project context and tech stack
✅ **Do**: Understand the technology being used and what expertise it requires

## Evolution and Refinement

This framework should evolve based on:
- Actual routing outcomes and their effectiveness
- User feedback on routing decisions
- New patterns discovered in real-world usage
- Model capability updates (if Gemini/Codex strengths change)

Periodically review routing decisions and refine the framework to improve accuracy and user experience.
